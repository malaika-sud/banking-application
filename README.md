# banking-application
Full-stack banking application - Malaika Sud.

For this application I hope to advance my knowledge of new and emerging technologies and learn through practice how to implement a web application using a full stack of React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and mySQL.

The inspiration behind this project is from my first encounter with online banking, and recently opening up my first account. Being able to access my funds through such user-friendly applications was incredibly fascinating to me, and I knew that I wanted to expand my area of coding expertise beyond just back-end development that I've learned in my classes.
